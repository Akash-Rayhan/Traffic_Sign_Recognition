# Traffic_Sign_Recognition
In this project I implemented Convolutional Neural Network to classify the German Traffic Signs.
You can the find the dataset here:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
Developed a deep learning algorithm on German traffic sign images that would classify unlabeled traffic signs. 
Preprocessing images using OpenCV.
Custom CNN architecture was built using Keras(high level API for tensorflow).
